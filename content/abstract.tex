\begin{abstract}

This thesis explains the importance of efficient simulation builds for functional verification of FPGA-designs in the context of quantum computing. A foundational insight into the environment of quantum computing and functional verification is given. It illustrates the problem of complicated simulation work flows and shows possibilities for enhancement using the \texttt{make} build automation tool. An example of implementation is described and reflected showing opportunities for further development.
